Additionally,the investor is considering to open a new hotel in Kortrijk. There are 3 interesting location for building a new hotel (Lange steenstraat 11, Herderstraat 139 and Merellaan 12).The investor wants to know which location is suited to build a new hotel. However, the design should permit rating a hotels location over all of West-Flanders.


#Data:

The Foursquare API will be used to fetch data related to hotels in West-Flanders, subsequently, Foursquare will be used to retrieve all venues in proximity for each hotel. 
Next, a classifier will be build to predict high rated hotels (rating >8) based on nearby venues and used to predict whether the specified locations are suited to build a new hotel.
For example, the proximity of hotels, museums, parks might be a deciding factor in the rating of new hotels. Considering these features might increase the probability of selecting the right location to build a new hotel.
